# parkeasy
(Written in Python 27)
A very basic project to deploy in a fee-based parking lot.

IMPORTANT:
I made this very basic project when I was in school, now I want to start contributing to open-source projects
and also want to improve my programming and teamwork skills.
I welcome all the contributers who want to help me improve the project in any aspect, like design, stablility, efficiency and scalability.
I would appreciate any advice and contribution.
